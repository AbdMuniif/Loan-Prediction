Machine Learning Pipeline Design to Predict Status of a Loan 
==============================
This project is a loan prediction pipeline designed to predict the status of loan applications. 
It utilizes the LightGBM model, known for its efficiency and performance in handling large datasets. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, feature encoding, and model training stages. The LightGBM model is saved for integrated into the prototype for user testing.The prototype, built with Gradio, provides an interactive interface for testing and improving the model's performance.

Directory Structure
-------------------
- `data` Dataset used in the project.
- `models` The LightGBM model is save here for integration into the prototype.
- `Loan` Python script of data training, model development, and experimentation.
- `app.py` Python script for the Gradio user interface or testing.

Installation (Terminal)
------------
pip install pandas scikit-learn lightgbm matplotlib joblib gradio

Make sure to install the necessary libraries and modules before running the project.
